## Affordability of Rent in Seattle Neighborhoods Based on the Income of Various Industries  

This project serves as a Capstone for my Data Science Certificate at Galvanize. It is currently in the early development stages.   
  
My goal is to create an interactive map, breaking Seattle down by neighborhood and displaying the affordability of rent for various industries over the last seven years.  

Being a Seattle native, the affordability of the rent in the city has been an alarming reality I've consistently faced, as well as most people I know. As the wealth disparity in the city increases, then rental market caters less and less to people in the lower class. I believe a visual representation of this trend will be a useful tool.  

I am sourcing data from Zillow, public records of King County home sales, as well as the Employment Security Department.
