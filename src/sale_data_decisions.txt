To find the sale records associated with Seattle zip-codes, I used multiple dataframes from the King County Department of Assessments. I joined Real Property Sales with the Residential Building and Condo Unit dataframes, so as to only retrieve sales of residential dwellings.

In aggregating this data, I chose to only consider homes and condos with 1-4 bedrooms, as these represent the majority of residential property sales that occur. Additionally, I only considered condos labeled as 'Flat' and 'Townhome'. These classifications are representative of standard condo sales, and offered an adequate amount of condo sale data.

When grouping by year and zip-code I took the median sale prices, as these more accurately represent standard pricing and don't give weight to outliers.
